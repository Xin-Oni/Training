# ðŸ§  Training

This is my personal practice repository for learning **machine learning with Python**.  
I'm still a beginner, so this is just a place to try things out and take notes.

## ðŸ“Œ What I'm doing here

- Trying out basic machine learning code
- Practicing how to use libraries like:
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
- Learning how to use Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colab
- Saving my progress and code on GitHub

## ðŸ’¬ Notes

This is not a professional project.  
Just a learning space for myself.  
Feel free to look around!
