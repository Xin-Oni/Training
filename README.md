# 🧠 Training

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Training Ground**!  
This repository is dedicated to hands-on practice with Python-based machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Purpose

To learn and reinforce key machine learning concepts using Python.  
I will experiment with libraries like:

- `scikit-learn`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `XGBoost`, `LightGBM` (planned)

## 🛠️ Contents

| Folder/File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `01_basic_models.ipynb` | Simple linear regression & classification |
| `02_preprocessing.ipynb` | Data cleaning and feature engineering |
| `03_model_selection.ipynb` | Train/test split, cross-validation |
| `README.md` | You're reading it! |

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn the basics of supervised and unsupervised learning
- Practice evaluation metrics and model selection
- Get comfortable using Jupyter notebooks and GitHub

## 🔧 Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
